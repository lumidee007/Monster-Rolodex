The app uses React's useState hook to manage the app's state and useEffect hook to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API when the component mounts. The app also uses the RoboHash API to generate images for the monsters. The app is built with reusable components and has a simple search functionality that filters the monsters based on the user's input.
